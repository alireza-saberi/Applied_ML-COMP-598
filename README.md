<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">
The goal of this study was to predict the fare
amount of a specific taxi pick-up in NYC. We used data from a
random sample of 200,000 taxi trips that occurred during
February and March 2013 in Manhattan, NYC and considered
seven predictors that contained information about the location,
weather, and time of the pick-up. We used two different linear
regression methods (standard linear regression and ridge
regression) to predict the outcome. To select the optimal
parameters for each regression method, we performed 2-fold
cross-validation on 50% of the data (training set) and evaluated
the performance of the final models on the remaining 50%
(testing set). Overall, we found that both regression methods
performed similarly and could not predict the outcome very well.
The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions was
approximately 7.5 in the testing set, which was quite large
compared to the average taxi fare amount of $10.75. Although
the NYC taxi dataset could not answer our prediction question
very well, the information contained in the NYC taxi datasets
could be useful for other future applications, especially when
linked with additional data sources</p>
